# EcoCord: A Discord Ecosystem Simulator

![EcoCord Logo](assets/readme/logo.png)

Welcome to EcoCord, an innovative Discord bot that transforms your server's activity into a living, breathing ecosystem! Created for the Python Code Jam 2024 with the theme of "Information Overload," EcoCord turns the constant stream of messages, reactions, and user interactions into a vibrant, visual representation of your community's digital life.

## What is EcoCord?

EcoCord is a unique Discord bot that creates a dynamic ecosystem based on your server's activity. It visualizes user interactions as various creatures in a simulated environment, bringing your community to life in a whole new way!

### Key Features:

- **Real-time Ecosystem Visualization**: Watch as your server's activity is transformed into a lively ecosystem with birds, snakes, and frogs representing active users.
- **Activity-based Interactions**: The more active your server, the more vibrant and diverse the ecosystem becomes!
- **User Avatars**: See your community members represented as cute critters with their own avatars.
- **Word Clouds**: Popular topics and frequently used words appear as dynamic word clouds in the sky.
- **Reaction Emojis**: Watch as reaction emojis float across the screen, adding extra flair to your ecosystem.
- **GIF Generation**: Automatically generate and share GIFs of your server's ecosystem in action.

## How It Works

EcoCord listens to various events in your Discord server:

1. **Messages**: Each message spawns or activates a critter in the ecosystem.
2. **Reactions**: Emojis used in reactions appear and animate in the environment.
3. **Typing**: Users typing are represented by their critters becoming more active.

As these events occur, the ecosystem evolves:

- Critters move around, interact, and respond to the overall activity level.
- Word clouds form and dissipate based on message content.

### Critter Types

EcoCord features three main types of critters, each with unique behaviors and representations:

1. **Birds**:
   - Fly smoothly across the sky
   - Change direction randomly
   - Flap their wings as they move

2. **Snakes**:
   - Slither along the ground
   - Move in a sinusoidal pattern
   - Grow longer as they become more active

3. **Frogs**:
   - Hop around the lower part of the ecosystem
   - Have distinct rest and jump states
   - Scale in size based on their vertical position

Each critter type is designed to represent different aspects of user activity and add variety to the ecosystem visualization.

## Technical Challenges

EcoCord overcomes several technical challenges to create a seamless and engaging experience:

1. **GIF Generation and Multithreading**:
   - Utilizes a separate process for GIF generation to avoid blocking the main application
   - Implements a shared memory approach using `multiprocessing.Array` for efficient frame sharing between processes
   - Manages concurrent access to shared resources with locks and queues
   - Generates GIFs in under 1s on typical hardware

2. **SQLite Database Integration**:
   - Uses `aiosqlite` for asynchronous database operations
   - Stores and retrieves guild configurations and user information

3. **Efficient Rendering with Pygame**:
   - Optimizes drawing operations to handle multiple moving entities
   - Implements custom drawing algorithms for each critter type
   - Manages transparency and layering for complex visual effects
   - Parallax scrolling of background clouds to add depth to the ecosystem

4. **Discord API Integration**:
   - Handles real-time events from Discord using `discord.py`
   - Manages rate limits and connection issues gracefully
   - Implements command handling and permission checks for bot configuration

5. **Dynamic Word Cloud Generation**:
   - Processes message content in real-time to extract relevant words
   - Generates and updates word clouds based on frequently used terms
   - Integrates word clouds seamlessly into the ecosystem visualization with masking

6. **Avatar Integration and Image Processing**:
   - Fetches and processes user avatars from Discord
   - Applies masks and transformations to integrate avatars with critter designs
   - Handles various image formats and sizes efficiently

These technical solutions work together to create a responsive, visually appealing, and interactive ecosystem that accurately represents the activity in your Discord server.

## Connection to the Theme: Information Overload

EcoCord tackles the theme of "Information Overload" by:

1. **Visualizing Data**: Transforming the overwhelming stream of Discord messages and events into a visually appealing and easily digestible format.
2. **Aggregating Information**: Combining multiple data points (messages, reactions, user activity) into a single, coherent representation.
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: The ecosystem evolves based on the volume and type of information, providing a real-time view of server activity.
4. **Filtering and Focusing**: By representing users as critters and popular topics as word clouds, EcoCord helps users focus on key information amidst the noise.

## Innovation Spotlight

EcoCord stands out in addressing "Information Overload" through its unique approach:

1. **Dynamic Visualization**: We transform raw data into an engaging, living ecosystem.
2. **Intelligent Aggregation**: Our algorithm combines multiple data points to create meaningful representations.
3. **Scalability**: EcoCord efficiently handles high-volume servers without performance degradation.

### Key Innovation: Efficient GIF Generation

Our multithreaded GIF generation process is a standout feature:

```python
@staticmethod
async def _gif_generation_process(
    shared_frames: SharedNumpyArray,
    current_frame_index: multiprocessing.Value,
    frame_count_queue: multiprocessing.Queue,
    gif_info_queue: multiprocessing.Queue,
    fps: int,
) -> None:
    frames = shared_frames.get_array()

    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        while True:
            frame_count = frame_count_queue.get()
            if frame_count is None:
                break

            start_index = current_frame_index.value
            ordered_frames = np.roll(frames, -start_index, axis=0)

            frames = list(executor.map(Image.fromarray, ordered_frames))

            duration = int(1000 / fps)

            with io.BytesIO() as gif_buffer:
                optimized_frames[0].save(
                    gif_buffer,
                    format="GIF",
                    save_all=True,
                    append_images=frames[1:],
                    optimize=False,
                    duration=[duration] * (len(frames)),
                    loop=0,
                )

                gif_data = gif_buffer.getvalue()

            gif_info_queue.put((gif_data, time.time()))
```

This approach allows us to generate high-quality GIFs efficiently, even for servers with thousands of messages per minute. Key features include:

1. Asynchronous processing using `asyncio`
2. Shared memory for frame data using `SharedNumpyArray`
3. Multithreading for frame optimization
4. Efficient frame ordering and GIF creation

### Running EcoCord

1. Start the bot:
   ```
   poetry run run
   ```

2. Invite the bot to your Discord server using the OAuth2 URL generated for your bot in the Discord Developer Portal.

The bot should be configured for a Guild Install, with the `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes, and `Attach Files`, `Create Public Threads`, `Embed Links`, `Read Message History`, `Send Messages`, `Send Messages in Threads`, `Use Slash Commands`, and `View Channels` permissions.

3. Use the `/configure` command in your server to set up the channels where EcoCord will operate.


## Configuration

To set up EcoCord in your server, use the `/configure` command. This command allows you to specify which channels the bot should monitor and where it should post ecosystem GIFs.

![Configure Command](assets/readme/configure.png)

The configuration options include:

- **Ecosystem Channel**: The channel where EcoCord will monitor activity and generate the ecosystem.
- **GIF Channel**: The channel where EcoCord will post generated GIFs of the ecosystem.

After running the `/configure` command, follow the prompts to select the appropriate channels. EcoCord will then start monitoring the specified ecosystem channel and post GIFs in the designated GIF channel.


## Usage

Once EcoCord is running in your server, it will automatically start creating and updating the ecosystem based on server activity. Here are some key commands and features:

- `/configure`: Set up the channels where EcoCord will operate and where GIFs will be posted.
- Activity Visualization: Watch the ecosystem change in real-time as your server becomes more or less active.
- GIF Generation: Periodically, EcoCord will generate and post GIFs of the ecosystem in threads in the designated channel.
