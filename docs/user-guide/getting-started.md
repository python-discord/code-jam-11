# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started using the Courageous Comets Discord bot. You'll learn how to use the bot
to explore a new server and connect with its members.

We've all experienced the feeling of joining a new server and not knowing where to start. With Courageous Comets,
you can quickly get an overview of what a server is about and whether or not it's a good fit for you.

## Finding your way around

Let's say you've just joined the Python Discord server and you are interested in web development with Django.
Let's use the search feature to find the most recent messages related to those topics.

Type the following command in any channel:

```plaintext
/search query:"web development with Django"
```

The bot will return a list of messages that are relevant to your query. The search results include references to
the channels and message authors, so you can get an idea of where the conversation is happening.

The search feature is also available as a context menu option when you right-click on a message. This allows you
to search for similar messages to the one you selected.

## Discovering new communities

If you're looking for a new community to join, you can ask the bot to find channels that match your interests.
Let's say you're excited to learn more about programming and are looking for people who feel the same way.

Try the following command:

```plaintext
/sentiment_search query: "excited to learn about programming"
```

The bot will return a list of messages that share your sentiment. Again, the results include the channels and authors
of the messages to help you explore further.

The sentiment search feature is also available as a context menu option when you right-click on a message. This
allows to find messages with similar sentiments to the one you selected.
