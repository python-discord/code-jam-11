# Installing the Bot

This guide will help you get started with the Courageous Comets Discord bot. You'll learn how to invite the bot
to your server and use its admin features.

## Installation

Adding the bot to your Discord server is easy - just click the button below!

[Add to Discord :fontawesome-brands-discord:](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1262672493978714174){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Initial Setup

Once the bot is added to your server, you will need to make the bot's interactions available to your users. You
can do so by mentioning the bot and using the `sync` command as shown below:

```plaintext
@Courageous Comets sync
```

After running the `sync` command, the bot will confirm the number of interactions that are now available.

??? TIP "Run the `sync` command regularly"

    It's a good idea to run the `sync` command regularly to stay up-to-date with the latest features and interactions.

You're all set! The bot is now ready to use on your server.

!!! SUCCESS "Results may vary initially"

    The quality of responses will improve over time as the bot collects more data. The more active your server
    is, the faster the bot will learn.
